* Action plans 09/2025
    * Sound instruments
        - what are interesting sounds ?
        - sound transformations, not only dry synthesis
        - use wave shape as spectral filter
            - noise or wave sound input?
            - voice input?
        - granular textures
        - rhythmic patterns
            - modulations of rhythmic patterns
    * Wave statistics   
        - numpeaks
        - peak distances
            - max, min, average
        - amp
            - average, max, min
        - curvature
            - max, min, average
        - roughness
            - FFT of each column and row? 3D FFT?
            - size and shape of texture elements
        - num peaks per zero crossing
        * contour extraction
        * sparse optical flow
            - create mask to focus on relevant area
            - investigate corner detection: good features to track
        * rope_fade_filter
            - track only things that change, with IIR lowpass
            - could also create a FIR lowpass?
        * display of analyzed features  
            - FFT
            - numpeaks
            - roughness
            - curvature max, min    
    * 2 or more ropes
        - no 1D wave
        - use open cv contours?
            - N largest contours, size, shape, area, curvature
    * Keep last shape when no movement
        - also for 1D wave
        - contours
    * Sparks, downsampling
        - finish map to granular sparks
    * Better organization of sketches for exploration
        - file naming
        - py+csound sets
        - better organization of source videos
            - all videos in one folder
            - method for reshaping/resampling different image resolutions
            - method for different video frame rates in source
            - method for masking based on ratios from full frame
        - better organization of processing methods
            - library file with processing functions
        - directories for
            - source videos
            - library functions
            - different experiments in separate folders
                - py + csound file in each
                - use ../video/videoname for source
    * Rope optical flow
    * Wave pool Inderøy as source
    * Write wave statistics to image for output
        - allow pause and investigate
        




* Extract 1D waveform. Working
* Peak id and peak tracking. Working

* Simple audio mapping shows that it works, but sounds too simple and naive.
    - maybe tracking each single wave (form and shape) is not the thing
* Use more complex sonification/synthesis initially, even if it is less direct and concrete
    - granular processes, additive textures, modulations
    - anything that sounds good and that can bee modulated

* Taking a step back
    - Extract more general features, how does it look?
    - number of items/things/features moving around. Wave frequency
    - general shape (even of the 1D wave), 
        - smoothness/curvature (Timbre)
        - number of waves, distance between shapes (Frequency)
        * simplify rope tracking to just extract general statistics of the 1D wave
    - downsample heavily (16x12), create big pixels, simply track change (threshold)
        - trigger short noise click on each

* Open CV feature descriptors

    "how would I extract textures and wave shapes from a video using open cv in python"
    - Local Binary Patterns (LBP): LBP is a robust texture descriptor that creates a binary pattern for each pixel based on its neighbors.
    - Gabor Filters: Gabor filters are useful for detecting specific orientations and frequencies in textures.
    - lbp_image = local_binary_pattern(gray_frame, n_points, radius, method="uniform")
